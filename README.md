# Semester Project 2 - Auction House Website

## Project Overview

This project is my submission for the Semester Project 2 in Front-End Development at Noroff School og Technology and Digital Media.

Eminence Listings is a luxury auction platform where users can list items for bidding and place bids on other listings. Users start with 1000 credits and can earn more by selling items or spending credits to place bids. The platform ensures an engaging and competitive experience for registered users while allowing non-registered users to browse listings.

This project is the front-end for an existing API, developed using TailwindCSS and hosted on Netlify.
